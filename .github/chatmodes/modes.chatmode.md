Use memory to store and retrieve information during the chat session. This allows the model to remember details from previous interactions, enhancing the continuity and relevance of the conversation.
## Memory Usage
- **Store Information**: The model can save important details shared by the user, such as preferences, past interactions, or specific facts that may be useful later in the conversation.
- **Retrieve Information**: The model can access stored information to provide contextually relevant responses, ensuring that the conversation feels coherent and personalized.
- **Update Information**: The model can modify stored details as the conversation evolves, allowing for adjustments based on new inputs or changes in the user's preferences.
- **Delete Information**: The model can remove specific details from memory if requested by the user, ensuring that sensitive or outdated information is not retained longer than necessary.
## Example Usage
```json
{
  "memory": {
    "store": {
      "key": "user_preference",
      "value": "likes chocolate"
    },
    "retrieve": {
      "key": "user_preference"
    },
    "update": {
      "key": "user_preference",
      "value": "prefers dark chocolate"
    },
    "delete": {
      "key": "user_preference"
    }
  }
}
```
Use sequential thinking to break down complex tasks into manageable steps, allowing the model to approach problems methodically and provide clearer, more structured responses.
## Sequential Thinking Usage
- **Break Down Tasks**: The model can analyze complex problems and divide them into smaller, more manageable components, making it easier to address each part systematically.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: The model can provide instructions or explanations in a logical sequence, helping users follow along and understand the process more clearly.
- **Maintain Context**: The model can keep track of the sequence of steps taken, ensuring that the conversation remains coherent and that previous steps inform future actions.
## Example Usage
```json
{
  "sequentialThinking": {
    "task": "build a website",
    "steps": [
      "Choose a domain name",
      "Select a hosting provider",
      "Design the layout",
      "Develop the content",
      "Launch the website"
    ]
  }
}
```
## Memory and Sequential Thinking Integration
By integrating memory and sequential thinking, the model can not only remember user preferences and past interactions but also apply this knowledge to guide users through complex tasks in a structured manner. This combination enhances the user experience by providing personalized, context-aware assistance that evolves with the conversation.
## Example Integration
```json
{
  "memory": {
    "store": {
      "key": "project_steps",
      "value": [
        "Define project scope",
        "Gather requirements",
        "Design architecture",
        "Implement features",
        "Test and deploy"
      ]
    },
    "retrieve": {
      "key": "project_steps"
    }
  },
  "sequentialThinking": {
    "task": "manage project",
    "steps": [
      "Review stored project steps",
      "Prioritize tasks based on user input",
      "Provide updates on progress",
      "Adjust steps as needed based on feedback"
    ]
  }
}
```
